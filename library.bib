abstract = {Patterns of interaction in any social system are accompanied by counter-patterns of withdrawal, one highly institutionalized (but unexplored) mode of which is privacy. There exists a threshold beyond which social contact becomes irritating for all parties; therefore, some provision for removing oneself from interaction and observation must be built into every establishment. Such provisions subserve the action patterns for which they provide intermission. Privacy, which is bought and sold in social establishments, reflects and affirms status divisions, and permits "localized" deviation which is invisible to the group as a whole. Privacy thereby unsulates against dysfunctional knowledge. Rules governing entrance into and exit from privacy are most clearly articulated on the level of the establishment and are reflected in its physical structure and in proprieties concerning the uses of space, doors, windows, drawers, etc. The report ends with a discussion of identity and its relation to the freedoms of engagement and disengagement.},

abstract = {Random projections have recently emerged as a powerful method for dimensionality reduction. Theoretical results indicate that the method preserves distances quite nicely; however, empirical results are sparse. We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burdensome computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally signiÔ¨Åcantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.},

In spectral clustering, as new data points are added continuously, dynamic data sets are processed in an on-line way to avoid costly re-computation. In this paper, we propose a new representative measure to compress the original data sets and maintain a set of representative points by continuously updating Eigen-system with the incidence vector. According to these extracted points we generate instant cluster labels as new data points arrive. Our method is effective and able to process large data sets due to its low time complexity. Experimental results over various real evolutional data sets show that our method provides fast and relatively accurate results.},

We present a function that resembles negative free energy and show that the M step maximizes this function with respect to the model parameters and the E step maximizes it with respect to the distribution over the unobserved variables. From this perspective, it is easy to justify an incremental variant of the EM algorithm in which the distribution for only one of the unobserved variables is recalculated in each E step. This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem. A variant of the algorithm that exploits sparse conditional distributions is also described, and a wide range of other variant algorithms are also seen to be possible.},

As a consequence, they miss opportunities to present quantities that are of greatest substantive interest for their research and express the appropriate degree of certainty about these quantities. In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently overlooked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors' own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.},

@article{Candes2006a,
abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f‚ààCN and a randomly chosen set of frequencies $\Omega$. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set $\Omega$? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=$\sigma$$\tau$‚ààTf($\tau$)$\delta$(t-$\tau$) obeying |T|‚â§CM{\textperiodcentered}(log N)-1 {\textperiodcentered} |$\Omega$| for some constant CM{\textgreater}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N-M), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ‚Ñì1 minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for CM which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|{\textperiodcentered}logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|{\textperiodcentered}logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

abstract = {The compressive sensing (CS) framework states that a signal that has a sparse representation in a known basis may be reconstructed from samples obtained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. The Fourier domain is widely used in CS applications due to its inherent properties. Sparse signal recovery applications using a small number of Fourier transform coefficients have made solutions to large-scale data recovery problems, including image recovery problems, more practical. The sparse reconstruction of 2D images is performed using the sampling patterns generated by taking the general frequency characteristics of the images into account. In this work, instead of forming a general sampling pattern for infrared (IR) images, a special sampling pattern is obtained by gathering a database to extract the frequency characteristics of IR sea-surveillance images. Experimental results show that the proposed sampling pattern provides better sparse recovery results compared to the widely used patterns proposed in the literature. It is also shown that, together with a certain image dataset, the sampling pattern generated by the proposed scheme can be generalized for various image sparse recovery applications.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need for algorithms that can accurately detect changepoints in long time-series, or equivalent, data. Many common approaches to detecting changepoints, for example based on penalised likelihood or minimum description length, can be formulated in terms of minimising a cost over segmentations. Dynamic programming methods exist to solve this minimisation problem exactly, but these tend to scale at least quadratically in the length of the time-series. Algorithms, such as Binary Segmentation, exist that have a computational cost that is close to linear in the length of the time-series, but these are not guaranteed to find the optimal segmentation. Recently pruning ideas have been suggested that can speed up the dynamic programming algorithms, whilst still being guaranteed to find true minimum of the cost function. Here we extend these pruning methods, and introduce two new algorithms for segmenting data, FPOP and SNIP. Empirical results show that FPOP is substantially faster than existing dynamic programming methods, and unlike the existing methods its computational efficiency is robust to the number of changepoints in the data. We evaluate the method at detecting Copy Number Variations and observe that FPOP has a computational cost that is competitive with that of Binary Segmentation.},

abstract = {A method is developed for representing any communication system geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two "function spaces," and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maxmum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.},

abstract = {In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

@article{Chen2011,
abstract = {Spectral clustering is one of the most popular cluster- ing approaches. Despite its good performance, it is lim- ited in its applicability to large-scale problems due to its high computational complexity. Recently, many ap- proaches have been proposed to accelerate the spectral clustering. Unfortunately, these methods usually sacri- fice quite a lot information of the original data, thus result in a degradation of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Landmark-based Spectral Clustering (LSC), for large scale clustering problems. Specifically, we select p (? n) representa- tive data points as the landmarks and represent the orig- inal data points as the linear combinations of these land- marks. The spectral embedding of the data can then be efficiently computed with the landmark-based represen- tation. The proposed algorithm scales linearly with the problem size. Extensive experiments showthe effective- ness and efficiency of our approach comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of video anomaly recovery from a sequence of spectrally compressed video frames. Analysis of anomalies occurring in both time and spectrum is important in video surveillance applications. We present a methodology for the recovery of anomalies such as moving objects and their spectral signatures from spectrally compressed video. The spectrally compressed video frames are obtained by using a Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) system. The CASSI system encodes a 3-D data cube containing both 2-D spatial information and spectral information in a single 2-D measurement. In the proposed methodology, we use the spectrally compressed video as columns of a large data matrix Q. Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) is then used to decompose Q into the stationary background and a sparse matrix capturing the anomalies in the foreground. The sparse matrix is then used jointly with Q to recover the spectral information of the objects of interest. An example for the recovery of video anomalies in a 3-channel spectral video system (RGB) is presented.},

abstract = {An important aspect of clustering algorithms is whether the partitions constructed on finite samples converge to a useful clustering of the whole data space as the sample size increases. This paper investigates this question for normalized and unnormalized versions of the popular spec- tral clustering algorithm. Surprisingly, the convergence of unnormalized spectral clustering is more difficult to handle than the normalized case. Even though recently some first results on the convergence of normal- ized spectral clustering have been obtained, for the unnormalized case we have to develop a completely new approach combining tools from numerical integration, spectral and perturbation theory, and probability. It turns out that while in the normalized case, spectral clustering usually converges to a nice partition of the data space, in the unnormalized case the same only holds under strong additional assumptions which are not always satisfied. We conclude that our analysis gives strong evidence for the superiority of normalized spectral clustering. It also provides a basis for future exploration of other Laplacian-based methods.},

In particular, we aim for the sparsest representation possible. In general, this requires a combinatorial optimization process. Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases and has shown that, under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases, and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation, this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically, minimizing the {\{}ell{\}}1 norm of the coefficients{\{}gamma{\}} . In this article, we obtain parallel results in a more general setting, where the dictionary D can arise from two or several bases, frames, or even less structured systems. We sketch three applications: separating linear features from planar ones in 3D data, noncooperative multiuser encoding, and identification of over-complete independent component models.},

In this work, we propose an algorithm to extract foreground silhouettes without modeling the intensity variation across time. Using a camera pair, the stereo mismatch is processed to produce a dense disparity based on a Total Variation (TV) framework. Experimental results show that with sudden changes of background appearance, our proposed TV disparity-based extraction outperforms intensity-based algorithms and existing stereo-based approaches based on temporal depth variation and stereo mismatch.},

abstract = {Background subtraction is a key method required to aid processing surveillance videos. Current methods require storing each pixel of every video frame, which can be wasteful as most of this information refers to the uninteresting background. Compressive sensing can offer an efficient solution by using the fact that foreground is often sparse in the spatial domain. By making this assumption and applying a specific recovery algorithm to a trained background, it is possible to reconstruct the foreground, using only a low dimensional representation of the difference between the current frame and the estimated background scene. Although new compressive sensing background subtraction algorithms are being created, no study has been made of the effect of recovery algorithms on performance of background subtraction. This is considered by applying both Basis Pursuit and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to a standard test video, and comparing their accuracy.},

abstract = {Partitioning a graph into groups of vertices such that those within each group are more densely connected than vertices assigned to different groups, known as graph clustering, is often used to gain insight into the organisation of large scale networks and for visualisation purposes. Whereas a large number of dedicated techniques have been recently proposed for static graphs, the design of on-line graph clustering methods tailored for evolving networks is a challenging problem, and much less documented in the literature. Motivated by the broad variety of applications concerned, ranging from the study of biological networks to the analysis of networks of scientific references through the exploration of communications networks such as the World Wide Web, it is the main purpose of this paper to introduce a novel, computationally efficient, approach to graph clustering in the evolutionary context. Namely, the method promoted in this article can be viewed as an incremental eigenvalue solution for the spectral clustering method described by Ng et al. (2001) [25]. The incremental eigenvalue solution is a general technique for finding the approximate eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix given a change. As well as outlining the approach in detail, we present a theoretical bound on the quality of the approximate eigenvectors using perturbation theory. We then derive a novel spectral clustering algorithm called Incremental Approximate Spectral Clustering (IASC). The IASC algorithm is simple to implement and its efficacy is demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets modelling the evolution of a HIV epidemic, a citation network and the purchase history graph of an e-commerce website. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although con- ditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article.

Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we sequence larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time-series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes most common procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints, that has a computational cost which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic, or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative methods. We also compare with Binary Segmentation and a genetic algorithm for finding changepoints, and show that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.},

The book covers the fundamentals that are imperative to understanding data streams and describes important applications, such as TCP/IP traffic, GPS data, sensor networks, and customer click streams. It also addresses several challenges of data mining in the future, when stream mining will be at the core of many applications. These challenges involve designing useful and efficient data mining solutions applicable to real-world problems. In the appendix, the author includes examples of publicly available software and online data sets. This practical, up-to-date book focuses on the new requirements of the next generation of data mining. Although the concepts presented in the text are mainly about data streams, they also are valid for different areas of machine learning and data mining.},

In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and element meshes| the classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While naive spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O(p n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O n 1=d for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs.},

abstract = {Recently, sparse coding has been successfully applied in visual tracking. The goal of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods based on sparse coding. We first analyze the benefits of using sparse coding in visual tracking and then categorize these methods into appearance modeling based on sparse coding (AMSC) and target searching based on sparse representation (TSSR) as well as their combination. For each categorization, we introduce the basic framework and subsequent improvements with emphasis on their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare the representative methods on a total of 20 test sequences. The experimental results indicate that: (1) AMSC methods significantly outperform TSSR methods. (2) For AMSC methods, both discriminative dictionary and spatial order reserved pooling operators are important for achieving high tracking accuracy. (3) For TSSR methods, the widely used identity pixel basis will degrade the performance when the target or candidate images are not aligned well or severe occlusion occurs. (4) For TSSR methods, ‚Ñì1‚Ñì1 norm minimization is not necessary. In contrast, ‚Ñì2‚Ñì2 norm minimization can obtain comparable performance but with lower computational cost. The open questions and future research topics are also discussed.},

The set of high probability mixing parameters not only provides MAP basis selection, but also yields relative probabilities that reveal potential ambiguity in the sparse model.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to deal with the problem of visual tracking in some challenging situations. In our approach, Gabor features of image are used for expressing the templates and candidate targets in order to enhance the robustness of the variations due to illumination and appearance changes. Then we cast tracking as a sparse approximation problem in a particle filter framework. Gabor features derived from the Gabor wavelets representation of image are robust to changes in illumination and expression of the target object. At the same time, the sparse representation is able to deal with the problem of noise, varying viewpoints, background clutter, and illumination changes. The sparse representation is achieved by solving the ‚Ñì1-regularized least square problem. The candidate target with the smallest residual error is considered as the target we want. Most of existing algorithms are unable to track objects for a long time because of the even-changing target and background. In order to overcome the drawback, the template set is renewed by using the incremental learning algorithm which is based on principal components analysis(PCA). We use our approach and other popular methods to track 4 challenging video sequences in which the target objects and the backgrounds change intensively and the targets are partially occluded sometimes. The results show that our method has more excellent performances compared with other methods.},

Given this, the last sixty years have seen many research efforts devoted to this task. To date, however, none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce superior data; that additional features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect's flight behavior, can be exploited to improve insect classification; that a Bayesian classification approach allows to efficiently learn classification models that are very robust to over-fitting, and a general classification framework allows to easily incorporate arbitrary number of features. We demonstrate the findings with large-scale experiments that dwarf all previous works combined, as measured by the number of insects and the number of species considered.},

However, as graph data grows in scale, it becomes increasingly more challenging to identify clusters. In this paper we propose an efficient clustering algorithm for largescale graph data using spectral methods. The key idea is to repeatedly generate a small number of "supernodes" connected to the regular nodes, in order to compress the original graph into a sparse bipartite graph. By clustering the bipartite graph using spectral methods, we are able to greatly improve efficiency without losing considerable clustering power.

The recent literature demonstrates that appropriate combinations of trackers can help balance the stability and flexibility requirements. We have developed a robust tracking algorithm using a local sparse appearance model (SPT) and K-Selection. A static sparse dictionary and a dynamically updated online dictionary basis distribution are used to model the target appearance. A novel sparse representation-based voting map and a sparse constraint regularized mean shift are proposed to track the object robustly. Besides these contributions, we also introduce a new selection-based dictionary learning algorithm with a locally constrained sparse representation, called K-Selection. Based on a set of comprehensive experiments, our algorithm has demonstrated better performance than alternatives reported in the recent literature.},

Approaches based on activity analysis provide intriguing possibilities for region-of-interest (ROI) processing since relevant activities and their locations are detected prior to higher-level processing such as object tracking, tagging, and classification. This strategy is essential for scalability of video analysis to cluttered environments with a multitude of objects and activities. Activity analysis approaches typically do not involve object tracking, and yet they inherently account for spatiotemporal dependencies. They are robust to clutter arising from multiple activities and contamination arising from poor background subtraction or occlusions. They can sometimes also be employed for fusing activities from multiple cameras. We illustrate successful application of activity analysis to anomaly detection in various scenarios, including the detection of abandoned objects, crowds of people, and illegal U-turns.},

abstract = {In recent years, spectral clustering method has gained attentions because of its superior performance compared to other traditional clustering algorithms such as K-means algorithm. The existing spectral clustering algorithms are all off-line algorithms, i.e., they can not incrementally update the clustering result given a small change of the data set. However, the capability of incrementally updating is essential to some applications such as real time monitoring of the evolving communities of websphere or blogsphere. Unlike traditional stream data, these applications require incremental algorithms to handle not only insertion/deletion of data points but also similarity changes between existing items. This paper extends the standard spectral clustering to such evolving data by introducing the incidence vector/matrix to represent two kinds of dynamics in the same framework and by incrementally updating the eigenvalue system. Our incremental algorithm, initialized by a standard spectral clustering, continuously and efficiently updates the eigenvalue system and generates instant cluster labels, as the data set is evolving. The algorithm is applied to a blog data set. Compared with recomputation of the solution by standard spectral clustering, it achieves similar accuracy but with much lower computational cost. Close inspection into the blog content shows that the incremental approach can discover not only the stable blog communities but also the evolution of the individual multi-topic blogs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a robust visual tracking method by casting tracking as a sparse approximation problem in a particle filter framework. In this framework, occlusion, noise, and other challenging issues are addressed seamlessly through a set of trivial templates. Specifically, to find the tracking target in a new frame, each target candidate is sparsely represented in the space spanned by target templates and trivial templates. The sparsity is achieved by solving an l1-regularized least-squares problem. Then, the candidate with the smallest projection error is taken as the tracking target. After that, tracking is continued using a Bayesian state inference framework. Two strategies are used to further improve the tracking performance. First, target templates are dynamically updated to capture appearance changes. Second, nonnegativity constraints are enforced to filter out clutter which negatively resembles tracking targets. We test the proposed approach on numerous sequences involving different types of challenges, including occlusion and variations in illumination, scale, and pose. The proposed approach demonstrates excellent performance in comparison with previously proposed trackers. We also extend the method for simultaneous tracking and recognition by introducing a static template set which stores target images from different classes. The recognition result at each frame is propagated to produce the final result for the whole video. The approach is validated on a vehicle tracking and classification task using outdoor infrared video sequences.},

abstract = {Detection of moving objects in video streams is the first relevant step of information extraction in many computer vision applications. Aside from the intrinsic usefulness of being able to segment video streams into moving and background components, detecting moving objects provides a focus of attention for recognition, classification, and activity analysis, making these later steps more efficient. We propose an approach based on self organization through artificial neural networks, widely applied in human image processing systems and more generally in cognitive science. The proposed approach can handle scenes containing moving backgrounds, gradual illumination variations and camouflage, has no bootstrapping limitations, can include into the background model shadows cast by moving objects, and achieves robust detection for different types of videos taken with stationary cameras. We compare our method with other modeling techniques and report experimental results, both in terms of detection accuracy and in terms of processing speed, for color video sequences that represent typical situations critical for video surveillance systems.},

We first propose that a ‚Äòlocal ' scale should be used to compute the affinity between each pair of points. This local scaling leads to better clustering especially when the data includes multiple scales and when the clusters are placed within a cluttered background. We further suggest exploiting the structure of the eigenvectors to infer automatically the number of groups. This leads to a new algorithm in which the final randomly initialized k-means stage is eliminated. 1},

When all the eigenvectors are used, graph partitioning exactly reduces to vector partitioning.

abstract = {We study the problem of determining the optimal low dimensional projection for maximising the separability of a binary partition of an unlabelled dataset, as measured by spectral graph theory. This is achieved by finding projections which minimise the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrices of the projected data, which corresponds to a non-convex, non-smooth optimisation problem. We show that the optimal univariate projection based on spectral connectivity converges to the vector normal to the maximum margin hyperplane through the data, as the scaling parameter is reduced to zero. This establishes a connection between connectivity as measured by spectral graph theory and maximal Euclidean separation. It also allows us to apply our methodology to the problem of finding large margin linear separators. The computational cost associated with each eigen-problem is quadratic in the number of data. To mitigate this problem, we propose an approximation method using microclusters with provable approximation error bounds. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a large collection of benchmark datasets and find that it compares favourably with existing methods for projection pursuit and dimension reduction for unsupervised data partitioning.},

However, the com-putational and/or communication resources required by the method in processing large-scale data are often prohibitively high, and practitioners are often required to perturb the original data in various ways (quantization, downsampling, etc) before invoking a spectral algorithm. In this paper, we use stochastic perturbation theory to study the effects of data perturbation on the performance of spectral clustering. We show that the error under perturbation of spectral clustering is closely related to the perturbation of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. From this result we derive approximate upper bounds on the clustering error. We show that this bound is tight empirically across a wide range of problems, suggesting that it can be used in practical settings to determine the amount of data reduction allowed in order to meet a specification of permitted loss in clustering performance.},

abstract = {Data stream mining is an active research area that has recently emerged to discover knowledge from large amounts of continuously generated data. In this context, several data stream clustering algorithms have been proposed to perform unsupervised learning. Nevertheless, data stream clustering imposes several challenges to be addressed, such as dealing with nonstationary, unbounded data that arrive in an online fashion. The intrinsic nature of stream data requires the development of algorithms capable of performing fast and incremental processing of data objects, suitably addressing time and memory limitations. In this article, we present a survey of data stream clustering algorithms, providing a thorough discussion of the main design components of state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, this work addresses the temporal aspects involved in data stream clustering, and presents an overview of the usually employed experimental methodologies. A number of references are provided that describe applications of data stream clustering in different domains, such as network intrusion detection, sensor networks, and stock market analysis. Information regarding software packages and data repositories are also available for helping researchers and practitioners. Finally, some important issues and open questions that can be subject of future research are discussed.},

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging http://repository.upenn.edu/cis{\_}papers/107},

The method is incremental - the spectral clustering algorithm is applied to the affinity matrix after each row/column is added - which makes it possible to inspect the clusters as new data points are added. The method is well suited to the problem of appearance-based, on-line topological mapping for mobile robots. In this problem domain, we show that we can reduce environment-dependent parameters of the clustering algorithm to just a single, intuitive parameter. Experimental results in large outdoor and indoor environments show that we can close loops correctly by computing only a fraction of the entries in the affinity matrix. The accompanying video clip shows how an example map is produced by the algorithm.},

Therefore calculating the distances from the centroids needs vector operations, since the average of abstract data points is undefined. Existing algorithms can be extended for those cases when the sole input is the distance matrix, and the exact representing vectors are unknown. This extension may be named relational k-means after a notation for a similar algorithm invented for fuzzy clustering. A method is then proposed for generalizing k-means for scenarios when the data points have absolutely no connection with a Euclidean space.},

abstract = {In this study, the effect of powder cellulose (PC) and 2 types of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC 101 and MCC 301) on pellet properties produced by an extrusion/spheronization process was investigated. The different investigated types of cellulose displayed different behavior during the extrusion/spheronization process. Pure PC was unsuitable for extrusion, because too much water was required and the added water was partly squeezed during the extrusion process. In contrast, MCC 101 and MCC 301 were extrudable at a wide range of water content, but the quality of the resulting products varied. In the extrusion/spheronization process, MCC 101 was the best substance, with easy handling and acceptable product properties. The properties of the extrudates and pellets were determined by Fourier transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). FT-Raman spectroscopy was able to distinguish between the original substances and also between the wet and dried extrudates. The particle sizes of the raw material and of the extrudates were determined by ESEM without additional preparation. For MCC, the size of the resulting particles within the extrudate or pellet was smaller. However, in the extrudates of PC, changes in particle size could not be observed. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2333009?origin=crossref},

We also survey recently proposed strategies for modeling ordinal response variables when the data have some type of clustering or when repeated measurement occurs at various occasions for each subject, such as in longitudinal studies. Primary models in that case include marginal models and cluster-specific (conditional) models for which effects apply conditionally at the cluster level. Re- lated discussion refers to multi-level and transitional models. The main empha- sis is on maximum likelihood inference, although we indicate certain models (e.g., marginal models,multi-level models) for which this can be computationally difficult.

CS has recently gained a lot of attention due to its exploitation of signal sparsity. Sparsity, an inherent characteristic of many natural signals, enables the signal to be stored in few samples and subsequently be recovered accurately, courtesy of CS. This article gives a brief background on the origins of this idea, reviews the basic mathematical foundation of the theory and then goes on to highlight different areas of its application with a major emphasis on communications and network domain. Finally, the survey concludes by identifying new areas of research where CS could be beneficial.},

Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications. This comprehensive, practical guide: Provides more than 800 references-40{\%} published since 1995 Includes an appendix listing available mixture software Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique for motion detection that incorporates several innovative mechanisms. For example, our proposed technique stores, for each pixel, a set of values taken in the past at the same location or in the neighborhood. It then compares this set to the current pixel value in order to determine whether that pixel belongs to the background, and adapts the model by choosing randomly which values to substitute from the background model. This approach differs from those based upon the classical belief that the oldest values should be replaced first. Finally, when the pixel is found to be part of the background, its value is propagated into the background model of a neighboring pixel. We describe our method in full details (including pseudo-code and the parameter values used) and compare it to other background subtraction techniques. Efficiency figures show that our method outperforms recent and proven state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computation speed and detection rate. We also analyze the performance of a downscaled version of our algorithm to the absolute minimum of one comparison and one byte of memory per pixel. It appears that even such a simplified version of our algorithm performs better than mainstream techniques.},

The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers. However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other recently proposed methods.},

abstract = {Background subtraction is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications, such as robotics and automated surveillance systems. The performance of high-level visions tasks such as object detection and tracking is dependent on effective foreground detection techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel background modeling algorithm that represents the background as a linear combination of dictionary atoms and the foreground as a sparse error, when one uses the respective set of dictionary atoms as basis elements to linearly approximate/reconstruct a new image. The dictionary atoms represent variations of the background model, and are learned from the training frames. The sparse foreground estimation during the training and performance phases is formulated as a Lasso [1] problem, while the dictionary update step in the training phase is motivated from the K-SVD algorithm [2]. Our proposed method works well in the presence of foreground in the training frames, and also gives the foreground masks for the training frames as a by-product of the batch training phase. Experimental validation is provided on standard datasets with ground truth information, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shown.},

In this paper, we explore the temporal redundancy in videos, and propose a block-based adaptive framework for compressed video sampling. It addresses the independent movement of different regions in a video, classifies blocks into different types depending on their inter-frame correlation, and adjusts the sampling and reconstruction strategies accordingly. Our framework also considers the diverse texture complexity of different regions, and adaptively adjusts the number of measurements collected for each region based on their sparsity. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework reduces the number of sampled measurements by 52{\%} to 80{\%} while still satisfying the quality constraint on the reconstructed frames. Compared to prior works, our proposed scheme improves the quality of the reconstructed frames and achieves a 0.8dB to 5.4dB gain in the average PSNR.},

abstract = {A normalized gaussian network (NGnet) (Moody {\&} Darken, 1989) is a network of local linear regression units. The model softly partitions the input space by normalized gaussian functions, and each local unit linearly approximates the output within the partition. In this article, we propose a new on-line EMalgorithm for the NGnet, which is derived from the batch EMalgorithm (Xu, Jordan, {\&}Hinton 1995), by introducing a discount factor. We show that the on-line EM algorithm is equivalent to the batch EM algorithm if a specific scheduling of the discount factor is employed. In addition, we show that the on-line EM algorithm can be considered as a stochastic approximation method to find the maximum likelihood estimator. A new regularization method is proposed in order to deal with a singular input distribution. In order to manage dynamic environments, where the input-output distribution of data changes over time, unit manipulation mechanisms such as unit production, unit deletion, and unit division are also introduced based on probabilistic interpretation. Experimental results show that our approach is suitable for function approximation problems in dynamic environments. We also apply our on-line EM algorithm to robot dynamics problems and compare our algorithm with the mixtures-of-experts family.},

abstract = {This thesis considers the application of changepoint detection methodology for the analysis of acoustic sensing signals. In the first part, we propose a detection procedure for changes in the second-order structure of a univariate time series. This utilises a penalised likelihood based on Whittle's approximation and allows for a non-linear penalty function. This procedure is subsequently used to detect changes in acoustic sensing data which correspond to external disturbances of the measuring cable. The second part shifts focus to multivariate time series, and considers the detection of changes which occur in only a subset of the variables. We introduce the concept of changepoint vectors which we use to model such changes. A dynamic programming scheme is proposed which obtains the optimal configuration of changepoint vectors for a given multivariate series. Consideration of pruning techniques suggests that these are not practically viable for this setting. We therefore introduce approxima-tions which vastly improve computational speed with negligible detrimental impact on accuracy.

@article{Li2004,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of background modeling for foreground object detection in complex environments. A Bayesian framework that incorporates spectral, spatial, and temporal features to characterize the background appearance is proposed. Under this framework, the background is represented by the most significant and frequent features, i.e., the principal features, at each pixel. A Bayes decision rule is derived for background and foreground classification based on the statistics of principal features. Principal feature representation for both the static and dynamic background pixels is investigated. A novel learning method is proposed to adapt to both gradual and sudden "once-off" background changes. The convergence of the learning process is analyzed and a formula to select a proper learning rate is derived. Under the proposed framework, a novel algorithm for detecting foreground objects from complex environments is then established. It consists of change detection, change classification, foreground segmentation, and background maintenance. Experiments were conducted on image sequences containing targets of interest in a variety of environments, e.g., offices, public buildings, subway stations, campuses, parking lots, airports, and sidewalks. Good results of foreground detection were obtained. Quantitative evaluation and comparison with the existing method show that the proposed method provides much improved results.},

@article{Baraniuk2007,
abstract = {The Shannon/Nyquist sampling theorem specifies that to avoid losing information when capturing a signal, one must sample at least two times faster than the signal bandwidth. In many applications, including digital image and video cameras, the Nyquist rate is so high that too many samples result, making compression a necessity prior to storage or transmission. In other applications, including imaging systems (medical scanners and radars) and high-speed analog- to-digital converters, increasing the sampling rate is very expensive. This lecture note presents a new method to capture and represent compressible signals at a rate significantly below the Nyquist rate. This method, called compressive sensing, employs nonadaptive linear projections that preserve the structure of the signal; the signal is then reconstructed from these projections using an optimization process.},

However, not much is known about mobile shopper marketing.

First, a modified adaptive Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is presented to describe the temporal distribution of each pixel, based on which the spatial distribution of background is constructed by using non-parametric density estimation. By fusing the temporal and spatial distribution model, a heuristic strategy is presented for background subtraction. To reduce the computational cost, a novel criterion for adaptively determining the components number of GMM and the integral image method for calculating the spatial distribution model are proposed. Several experiments show that the proposed method can effectively reduce false positives caused by sudden or gradual changes of the background, and maintains lower false negatives, compared with some representative algorithms.},

abstract = {Summary: " Statistical Pattern Recognition provides an introduction to statistical pattern theory and techniques, with material drawn from a wide range of fields, including the areas of engineering, statistics, computer science and the social sciences. The book describes techniques for analysing data comprising measurements made on individuals or objects.. The techniques are used to make a prediction such as disease of a patient, the type of object illuminated by a radar, economic forecast. Emphasis is placed on techniques for classification, a term used for predicting the class or group an object belongs to (based on a set of exemplars) and for methods that seek to discover natural groupings in a data set. Each section concludes with a description of the wide range of practical applications that have been addressed and the further developments of theoretical techniques and includes a variety of exercises, from 'open-book' questions to more lengthy projects. New material is presented, including the analysis of complex networks and basic techniques for analysing the properties of datasets and also introduces readers to the use of variational methods for Bayesian density estimation and looks at new applications in biometrics and security.

abstract = {We introduce an ensemble of classifiers-based approach for incremental learning of concept drift, characterized by nonstationary environments (NSEs), where the underlying data distributions change over time. The proposed algorithm, named Learn(++). NSE, learns from consecutive batches of data without making any assumptions on the nature or rate of drift; it can learn from such environments that experience constant or variable rate of drift, addition or deletion of concept classes, as well as cyclical drift. The algorithm learns incrementally, as other members of the Learn(++) family of algorithms, that is, without requiring access to previously seen data. Learn(++). NSE trains one new classifier for each batch of data it receives, and combines these classifiers using a dynamically weighted majority voting. The novelty of the approach is in determining the voting weights, based on each classifier's time-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. This approach allows the algorithm to recognize, and act accordingly, to the changes in underlying data distributions, as well as to a possible reoccurrence of an earlier distribution. We evaluate the algorithm on several synthetic datasets designed to simulate a variety of nonstationary environments, as well as a real-world weather prediction dataset. Comparisons with several other approaches are also included. Results indicate that Learn(++). NSE can track the changing environments very closely, regardless of the type of concept drift. To allow future use, comparison and benchmarking by interested researchers, we also release our data used in this paper.},

abstract = {Given a wavelet w and a noisy trace t + s * w + n, an approximation ≈ù of the spike train s can be obtained using the ‚Ñì1 norm. This extraction has the advantage of preserving isolated spikes in s. On some types of data the spike train ≈ù can represent s as a sparse series of spikes, which may be sampled at a rate higher than the sample rate of the data trace t. The extracted spike train ≈ù may be qualitatively much different than those commonly extracted using the ‚Ñì2 norm. The ‚Ñì1 norm can also be used to extract a wavelet ≈µ from a trace t when a spike train s is known. This wavelet extraction can be constrained to give a smooth wavelet which integrates to zero and goes to zero at the ends. Given a trace t and an initial approximation for either s or w, it is possible to alternately extract spike trains and wavelets to improve the representation of trace t. Although special algorithms have been developed to solve ‚Ñì1 problems, all of the calculations can be performed using a general linear programming system. ...},

abstract = {In a typical video analysis framework, video sequences are decoded and reconstructed in the pixel domain before being processed for high level tasks such as classification or detection.Nevertheless, in some application scenarios, it might be of interest to complete these analysis tasks without disclosing sensitive data, e.g. the identity of people captured by surveillance cameras. In this paper we propose a new coding scheme suitable for video surveillance applications that allows tracking of video objects without the need to reconstruct the sequence,thus enabling privacy protection. By taking advantage of recent findings in the compressive sensing literature, we encode a video sequence with a limited number of pseudo-random projections of each frame. At the decoder, we exploit the sparsity that characterizes background subtracted images in order to recover the location of the foreground object. We also leverage the prior knowledge about the estimated location of the object, which is predicted by means of a particle filter, to improve the recovery of the foreground object location. The proposed framework enables privacy, in the sense it is impossible to reconstruct the original video content from the encoded random projections alone, as well as secrecy, since decoding is prevented if the seed used to generate the random projections is not available.},

abstract = {We propose a new technique, called Wild Binary Segmentation (WBS), for consistent estimation of the number and locations of multiple change-points in data. We assume that the number of change-points can increase to infinity with the sample size. Due to a certain random localisation mechanism, WBS works even for very short spacings between the change-points, unlike standard Binary Segmentation. On the other hand, despite its use of localisation, WBS does not require the choice of a window or span parameter, and does not lead to a significant increase in computational complexity. WBS is also easy to code. We propose two stopping criteria for WBS: one based on thresholding and the other based on what we term the ‚Äústrengthened Schwarz Information Criterion‚Äù. We provide default recommended values of the parameters of the procedure and show that it offers very good practical performance in comparison with the state of the art. In addition, we provide a new proof of consistency of Binary Segmentation with improved rates of convergence, as well as a corresponding result for WBS.},

@article{Ning2010,
abstract = {In recent years, the spectral clustering method has gained attentions because of its superior performance. To the best of our knowledge, the existing spectral clustering algorithms cannot incrementally update the clustering results given a small change of the data set. However, the capability of incrementally updating is essential to some applications such as websphere or blogsphere. Unlike the traditional stream data, these applications require incremental algorithms to handle not only insertion/deletion of data points but also similarity changes between existing points. In this paper, we extend the standard spectral clustering to such evolving data, by introducing the incidence vector/matrix to represent two kinds of dynamics in the same framework and by incrementally updating the eigen-system. Our incremental algorithm, initialized by a standard spectral clustering, continuously and efficiently updates the eigenvalue system and generates instant cluster labels, as the data set is evolving. The algorithm is applied to a blog data set. Compared with recomputation of the solution by the standard spectral clustering, it achieves similar accuracy but with much lower computational cost. It can discover not only the stable blog communities but also the evolution of the individual multi-topic blogs. The core technique of incrementally updating the eigenvalue system is a general algorithm and has a wide range of applications-as well as incremental spectral clustering-where dynamic graphs are involved. This demonstrates the wide applicability of our incremental algorithm. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We propose a sparse-coding framework for activity recognition in ubiquitous and mobile computing that alleviates two fundamental problems of current supervised learning approaches. (i) It automatically derives a compact, sparse and meaningful feature representation of sensor data that does not rely on prior expert knowledge and generalizes well across domain boundaries. (ii) It exploits unlabeled sample data for bootstrapping effective activity recognizers, i.e., substantially reduces the amount of ground truth annotation required for model estimation. Such unlabeled data is easy to obtain, e.g., through contemporary smartphones carried by users as they go about their everyday activities. Based on the self-taught learning paradigm we automatically derive an over-complete set of basis vectors from unlabeled data that captures inherent patterns present within activity data. Through projecting raw sensor data onto the feature space defined by such over-complete sets of basis vectors effective feature extraction is pursued. Given these learned feature representations, classification backends are then trained using small amounts of labeled training data. We study the new approach in detail using two datasets which differ in terms of the recognition tasks and sensor modalities. Primarily we focus on a transportation mode analysis task, a popular task in mobile-phone based sensing. The sparse-coding framework demonstrates better performance than the state-of-the-art in supervised learning approaches. More importantly, we show the practical potential of the new approach by successfully evaluating its generalization capabilities across both domain and sensor modalities by considering the popular Opportunity dataset. Our feature learning approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches to analyzing activities of daily living.},

'Big Data' then asks the awkward questions: What are the unspoken assumptions underlying its methods? Are we being bamboozled by mega data's size, its speed, and its shiny technology? Nobody needs a degree in computer science to follow Harkness's exploration of what mega data can do for us--and what it can't or shouldn't. 'Big Data' asks you to decide: Are you a data point, or a human being?"--Provided by publisher. Big data knows where you've been and who your friends are. It knows what you like and what makes you angry. It can predict what you'll buy, where you'll be the victim of crime and when you'll have a heart attack. Big data knows you better than you know yourself, or so it claims. But how well do you know big data? You've probably seen the phrase in newspaper headlines, at work in a marketing meeting, or on a fitness-tracking gadget. But can you understand it without being a Silicon Valley nerd who writes computer programs for fun? Yes, you can. Timandra Harkness writes comedy, not computer code. The only programs she makes are on the radio. If you can read a newspaper, you can read this book. Starting with the basics--what IS data? And what makes it big?--Timandra takes you on a whirlwind tour of how people are using big data today: from science to smart cities, business to politics, self-quantification to the Internet of Things. Finally, she asks the big questions about where it's taking us; is it too big for its boots, or does it think too small? Are you a data point or a human being? Will this book be full of rhetorical questions? No. It also contains puns, asides, unlikely stories and engaging people, inspiring feats and thought-provoking dilemmas.

It is based on kernel spectral clustering (KSC), a model designed in the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) framework, with primal-dual setting. The IKSC model is developed to quickly adapt itself to a changing environment, in order to learn evolving clusters with high accuracy. In contrast with other existing incremental spectral clustering approaches, the eigen-updating is performed in a model-based manner, by exploiting one of the Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the KSC problem. We test the capacities of IKSC with some experiments conducted on computer-generated data and a real-world data-set of PM10 concentrations registered during a pollution episode occurred in Northern Europe in January 2010. We observe that our model is able to precisely recognize the dynamics of shifting patterns in a non-stationary context.},

abstract = {Pen-based handwriting recognition has enormous practical utility.$\backslash$nIt is different from optical recognition in that the input is a temporal$\backslash$nsignal of pen movements as opposed to a static spatial pattern. We examine various ways of combining multiple learners which are trained with different representations of the same input signal: dynamic (pen movements) and static (final 2D image). We notice that the classifiers based on different representations fail for different patterns and investigate ways to combine the two representations. We benchmark voting, stacking, mixture of experts and cascading. In voting and stacking, the two are always used together. In the mixture of experts, the gating network chooses one of the two. In cascading, the static is used only when the dynamic is not certain. On a handwritten digit database significant increase in accuracy has been obtained.},

abstract = {Suppose we are given a vector f in a class FsubeRopfN , e.g., a class of digital signals or digital images. How many linear measurements do we need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision epsi in the Euclidean (lscr2) metric? This paper shows that if the objects of interest are sparse in a fixed basis or compressible, then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small number of random measurements by solving a simple linear program. More precisely, suppose that the nth largest entry of the vector |f| (or of its coefficients in a fixed basis) obeys |f|(n)lesRmiddotn-1p/, where R{\textgreater}0 and p{\textgreater}0. Suppose that we take measurements yk=langf{\#} ,Xkrang,k=1,...,K, where the Xk are N-dimensional Gaussian vectors with independent standard normal entries. Then for each f obeying the decay estimate above for some 0{\textless}p{\textless}1 and with overwhelming probability, our reconstruction ft, defined as the solution to the constraints yk=langf{\#} ,Xkrang with minimal lscr1 norm, obeys parf-f{\#}parlscr2lesCp middotRmiddot(K/logN)-r, r=1/p-1/2. There is a sense in which this result is optimal; it is generally impossible to obtain a higher accuracy from any set of K measurements whatsoever. The methodology extends to various other random measurement ensembles; for example, we show that similar results hold if one observes a few randomly sampled Fourier coefficients of f. In fact, the results are quite general and require only two hypotheses on the measurement ensemble which are detailed},

abstract = {Experiments have become an increasingly common tool for political science researchers over the last decade, particularly laboratory experiments performed on small convenience samples. The standard statistical paradigm used in political science is designed to connect samples to populations, while the inferential goal in an experiment is often about understand- ing whether an observed treatment effect occurred due to chance. In this paper, we outline an alternative derivation for statistical inference based on randomization of the treatment. While some standard tests approximate this form of inference, many do not and can produce incorrect inferences. These tests also have robust forms that are insensitive to the distribu- tion of the data. We outline common randomization tests, such as Wilcoxon rank tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test, and also develop a randomization test for two-way factorial designs as an alternative to the commonly used two-way ANOVA model. Finally, we reanalyze data from two political science experiments using randomization tests to illustrate the inferential errors that can be made when classical tests are used with data from the lab.},

abstract = {Spectral clustering has become one of the most popular clustering approaches in recent years. However, its high computational complexity prevents its application to large-scale datasets. To address this complexity, approximate spectral clustering methods have been proposed. In these methods, computational costs are reduced by using approximation techniques, such as the Nystr{\"{o}}m method, or by constructing a smaller representative dataset on which spectral clustering is performed. However, the computational efficiency of these approximation methods is achieved at the cost of performance degradation. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximate spectral clustering method in which clustering performance is improved by utilizing local information among the data, while the scalability to the large-scale datasets is retained. Specifically, we improve the approximate spectral clustering method in two aspects. First, a sparse affinity graph is adopted to improve the performance of spectral clustering on the small representative dataset. Second, local interpolation is utilized to improve the extension of the clustering result. Experiments are conducted on several real-world datasets, showing that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms the state-of-the-art approximate spectral clustering algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

An example of this great stability is seen when an average is, determined by using the median rather than the arithmetic mean.

abstract = {In a highly influential paper, Baron and Kenny (1986) proposed a statistical procedure to con- duct a causal mediation analysis and identify possible causal mechanisms. This procedure has been widely used across many branches of the social and medical sciences and especially in psychology and epidemiology. However, one major limitation of this approach is that it is based on a set of linear regressions and cannot be easily extended to more complex situations that are frequently encoun- tered in applied research. In this paper, we propose an approach that generalizes the Baron-Kenny procedure. Our method can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and non- parametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. We also provide a formal statistical justification for the proposed generalization of the Baron-Kenny pro- cedure by placing causal mediation analysis within the widely-accepted counterfactual framework of causal inference. Finally, we develop a set of sensitivity analyses that allow applied researchers to quantify the robustness of their empirical conclusions. Such sensitivity analysis is important because as we showthe Baron-Kenny procedure and our generalization of it rest on a strong and untestable as- sumption even in randomized experiments. We illustrate the proposed methods by applying them to a randomized field experiment, the Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II).We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all of our proposed methods.},

abstract = {Background: During the past decade, renewed global and national efforts to combat malaria have led to ambitious goals. We aimed to provide an accurate assessment of the levels and time trends in malaria mortality to aid assessment of progress towards these goals and the focusing of future efforts. Methods: We systematically collected all available data for malaria mortality for the period 1980-2010, correcting for misclassification bias. We developed a range of predictive models, including ensemble models, to estimate malaria mortality with uncertainty by age, sex, country, and year. We used key predictors of malaria mortality such as Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence, first-line antimalarial drug resistance, and vector control. We used out-of-sample predictive validity to select the final model. Findings: Global malaria deaths increased from 995 000 (95 uncertainty interval 711 000-1 412 000) in 1980 to a peak of 1 817 000 (1 430 000-2 366 000) in 2004, decreasing to 1 238 000 (929 000-1 685 000) in 2010. In Africa, malaria deaths increased from 493 000 (290 000-747 000) in 1980 to 1 613 000 (1 243 000-2 145 000) in 2004, decreasing by about 30 to 1 133 000 (848 000-1 591 000) in 2010. Outside of Africa, malaria deaths have steadily decreased from 502 000 (322 000-833 000) in 1980 to 104 000 (45 000-191 000) in 2010. We estimated more deaths in individuals aged 5 years or older than has been estimated in previous studies: 435 000 (307 000-658 000) deaths in Africa and 89 000 (33 000-177 000) deaths outside of Africa in 2010. Interpretation: Our findings show that the malaria mortality burden is larger than previously estimated, especially in adults. There has been a rapid decrease in malaria mortality in Africa because of the scaling up of control activities supported by international donors. Donor support, however, needs to be increased if malaria elimination and eradication and broader health and development goals are to be met.

However, due to the computational demands of these approaches, applications to large problems such as spatiotemporal data and high resolution imagery have been slow to appear. The contribution of this paper is a method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of grouping algorithms based on spectral partitioning making it feasible to apply them to very large grouping problems. Our approach is based on a technique for the numerical solution of eigenfunction problems known as the Nystr{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}m method. This method allows one to extrapolate the complete grouping solution using only a small number of samples. In doing so, we leverage the fact that there are far fewer coherent groups in a scene than pixels.},

@article{Lloyd1982,
abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likly to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for quanta, , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

abstract = {Despite occasional constructive pedagogical treatises on the topic in the past (e.g., Friedrich 1982), a common methodology for employing and interpreting interaction terms in regression analysis continues to elude the field; and, partly as a consequence, their misinterpretation remains sadly rampant. This paper aims to redress these problems. We first document the widespread and expanding use of interaction terms in political science. We then elaborate and support our claim that, despite the increased use of interaction terms in regression analyses, many inherently interactive arguments are not being modeled as such. Finally, we note and review several inconsistencies and much confusion in the literature regarding the substantive interpretation of interaction terms and the statistical inferences from the coefficient and standard-error estimates surrounding them. After this review, we discuss three pedagogical themes. First, we offer a generic consideration of the process of writing empirical models that embody interactive hypotheses. Our second theme focuses more specifically on a set of statistical practices and rules of thumb when utilizing interaction models suggested by previous methodological treatments of the topic and frequently employed in current political science literature. We demonstrate that many of these can be misleading. Finally, we discuss the presentation of interaction effects. We show that, while the existing practice of reporting standard errors for individual coefficients remains useful, that practice is decidedly insufficient regarding coefficients on interactive terms. Assessment of interaction effects virtually requires graphical or tabular presentation of results, neither of which is currently commonly published. In this context, we strongly suggest the use of effect-line graphs or conditional-coefficient tables, complete with standard errors, hypothesis tests, and/or confidence intervals of those effects or conditional coefficients. We show how to construct these graphs and tables, giving detailed spreadsheet formulae for doing so in addition to the standard mathematical formulae for their elements.},

abstract = {Spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix to partition points into disjoint clusters, with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity. In this paper, we derive a new cost function for spectral clustering based on a measure of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing this cost function with respect to the partition leads to a new spectral clustering algorithm. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to an algorithm for learning the similarity matrix. We develop a tractable approximation of our cost function that is based on the power method of computing eigenvectors.},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A frthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {Spectral clustering is a powerful clustering method for document data set. However, spectral clustering needs to solve an eigenvalue problem of the matrix converted from the similarity matrix corresponding to the data set. Therefore, it is not practical to use spectral clustering for a large data set. To overcome this problem, we propose the method to reduce the similarity matrix size. First, using k-means, we obtain a clustering result for the given data set. From each cluster, we pick up some data, which are near to the central of the cluster. We take these data as one data. We call these data set as " committee. " Data except for committees remain one data. For these data, we construct the similarity matrix. Definitely, the size of this similarity matrix is reduced so much that we can perform spectral clustering using the reduced similarity matrix},

abstract = {Partitioning a graph into groups of vertices such that those within each group are more densely connected than vertices assigned to different groups, known as graph clustering, is often used to gain insight into the organization of large scale networks and for visualization purposes. Whereas a large number of dedicated techniques have been recently proposed for static graphs, the design of on-line graph clustering methods tailored for evolving networks is a challenging problem, and much less documented in the literature. Motivated by the broad variety of applications concerned, ranging from the study of biological networks to graphs of scientific references through to the exploration of communications networks such as the World Wide Web, it is the main purpose of this paper to introduce a novel, computationally efficient, approach to graph clustering in the evolutionary context. Namely, the method promoted in this article is an incremental eigenvalue solution for the spectral clustering method described by Ng. et al. (2001). Be- yond a precise description of its practical implementation and an evaluation of its complexity, its performance is illustrated through numerical experiments, based on datasets modelling the evolution of a HIV epidemic and the purchase history graph of an e-commerce website.},

abstract = {Dynamic pricing, in which prices respond to supply and demand pressures in real time or near-real time, has long been used by airlines and hotels. Now dynamic pricing is making inroads in many different sectors including apparel, automobiles, consumer electronics, personal services, telecommunications and second-hand goods. These companies are making use of new findings on dynamic pricing and of increases in data-processing power to raise their average realized prices, thereby increasing revenues and profits. There are two mechanisms for dynamic pricing: posted prices that customers can see; and price- discovery mechanisms, in which customers determine prices through their own actions. These two mechanisms are employed in seven different forms: yield management (commonly used by airlines), demand-based pricing, three types of auctions, group buying and negotiations. The article describes eight situations for using the various forms of dynamic pricing. An important constraint in employing dynamic pricing is consumers' Latitude of Price Acceptance, which varies for different products and situations and which can be discovered through observation, surveys or analysis of demand elasticities. Customer participation in the pricing process decreases the chances of a consumer backlash. Customers also tend to embrace dynamic pricing in the following situations: where the price reflects intensity of demand for the product, there is communication between the seller and the consumer, and the price difference is explained by a difference in perceived value across channels through which the transaction occurred. The more the seller understands the buying cycles and habits of the customer, the more he is able to manage price margins to the rhythm of the customer's shopping, to segment customers and to develop price discrimination.},

abstract = {Experiments have become an increasingly common tool for political science researchers over the last decade, particularly laboratory experiments performed on small convenience samples. The standard statistical paradigm used in political science is designed to connect samples to populations, while the inferential goal in an experiment is often about understand- ing whether an observed treatment effect occurred due to chance. In this paper, we outline an alternative derivation for statistical inference based on randomization of the treatment. While some standard tests approximate this form of inference, many do not and can produce incorrect inferences. These tests also have robust forms that are insensitive to the distribu- tion of the data. We outline common randomization tests, such as Wilcoxon rank tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test, and also develop a randomization test for two-way factorial designs as an alternative to the commonly used two-way ANOVA model. Finally, we reanalyze data from two political science experiments using randomization tests to illustrate the inferential errors that can be made when classical tests are used with data from the lab.},

abstract = {This article reviews methodologies used for analyzing ordered categorical (ordinal) response variables. We begin by surveying models for data with a single ordinal response variable. We also survey recently proposed strategies for modeling ordinal response variables when the data have some type of clustering or when repeated measurement occurs at various occasions for each subject, such as in longitudinal studies. Primary models in that case include marginal models and cluster-specific (conditional) models for which effects apply conditionally at the cluster level. Re- lated discussion refers to multi-level and transitional models. The main empha- sis is on maximum likelihood inference, although we indicate certain models (e.g., marginal models,multi-level models) for which this can be computationally difficult. The Bayesian approach has also received considerable attention for categorical data in the past decade, and we survey recent Bayesian approaches to modeling ordinal response variables. Alternative, non-model-based, approaches are also available for certain types of inference.},

Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors' own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.},

There exists a threshold beyond which social contact becomes irritating for all parties; therefore, some provision for removing oneself from interaction and observation must be built into every establishment. Such provisions subserve the action patterns for which they provide intermission. Privacy, which is bought and sold in social establishments, reflects and affirms status divisions, and permits "localized" deviation which is invisible to the group as a whole. Privacy thereby unsulates against dysfunctional knowledge. Rules governing entrance into and exit from privacy are most clearly articulated on the level of the establishment and are reflected in its physical structure and in proprieties concerning the uses of space, doors, windows, drawers, etc. The report ends with a discussion of identity and its relation to the freedoms of engagement and disengagement.},

abstract = {Despite occasional constructive pedagogical treatises on the topic in the past (e.g., Friedrich 1982), a common methodology for employing and interpreting interaction terms in regression analysis continues to elude the field; and, partly as a consequence, their misinterpretation remains sadly rampant. This paper aims to redress these problems. We first document the widespread and expanding use of interaction terms in political science. We then elaborate and support our claim that, despite the increased use of interaction terms in regression analyses, many inherently interactive arguments are not being modeled as such. Finally, we note and review several inconsistencies and much confusion in the literature regarding the substantive interpretation of interaction terms and the statistical inferences from the coefficient and standard-error estimates surrounding them. After this review, we discuss three pedagogical themes. First, we offer a generic consideration of the process of writing empirical models that embody interactive hypotheses. Our second theme focuses more specifically on a set of statistical practices and rules of thumb when utilizing interaction models suggested by previous methodological treatments of the topic and frequently employed in current political science literature. We demonstrate that many of these can be misleading. Finally, we discuss the presentation of interaction effects. We show that, while the existing practice of reporting standard errors for individual coefficients remains useful, that practice is decidedly insufficient regarding coefficients on interactive terms. Assessment of interaction effects virtually requires graphical or tabular presentation of results, neither of which is currently commonly published. In this context, we strongly suggest the use of effect-line graphs or conditional-coefficient tables, complete with standard errors, hypothesis tests, and/or confidence intervals of those effects or conditional coefficients. We show how to construct these graphs and tables, giving detailed spreadsheet formulae for doing so in addition to the standard mathematical formulae for their elements.},

abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although con- ditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10{\%} of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

abstract = {In a highly influential paper, Baron and Kenny (1986) proposed a statistical procedure to con- duct a causal mediation analysis and identify possible causal mechanisms. This procedure has been widely used across many branches of the social and medical sciences and especially in psychology and epidemiology. However, one major limitation of this approach is that it is based on a set of linear regressions and cannot be easily extended to more complex situations that are frequently encoun- tered in applied research. In this paper, we propose an approach that generalizes the Baron-Kenny procedure. Our method can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and non- parametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. We also provide a formal statistical justification for the proposed generalization of the Baron-Kenny pro- cedure by placing causal mediation analysis within the widely-accepted counterfactual framework of causal inference. Finally, we develop a set of sensitivity analyses that allow applied researchers to quantify the robustness of their empirical conclusions. Such sensitivity analysis is important because as we showthe Baron-Kenny procedure and our generalization of it rest on a strong and untestable as- sumption even in randomized experiments. We illustrate the proposed methods by applying them to a randomized field experiment, the Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II).We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all of our proposed methods.},
